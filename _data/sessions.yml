  title: "Ransomware and Egypt: The Threat and How to Protect Your Organization"
  description: "In 2017 Egypt was one of the top countries affected by the WannaCry Ransomware, and, unfortunately, things have not gotten better. According to Trend Micro, Egypt accounts for more than a third of all ransomware attacks in North Africa. Egypt is an attractive target for ransomware cybercriminals because there are so many new business starting up, but they have limited budget for security.
This talk will review the ransomware threats, and discuss ways you can help defend your organization from ransomware, even on a tight budget. It will also provide an overview of resources you can use to better understand the threat and where to focus your limited security budget."

  description: "Deception is an evolving effective tool that will improve detection and defense capabilities of an enterprise netwrok. It can be integrated into existing defenses to provide more visibility into the enterprise, share threat intelligence data and feed SIEM with high probability alerts.

It is highly accurate and can provide deep insight into enterprise network to detect zero days and advanced APTs.

  title: "Hunt Evil"
  description: "The ability to block advanced threats improves each year, but we face adversaries who are determined and creative, and their techniques evolve just as quickly. This raises a few questions: When prevention fails, what do we have left to protect our organizations? How can we discover gaps as fast as possible? Having techniques in play to detect and respond to ongoing attacks quickly is as important as prevention.
Threat hunting is a critical discipline that more organizations are using to disrupt stealthy attacks before they become mega breaches. It is the active search for “unknown unknowns,” which describes new and novel attack behaviors that aren’t detected by current automated methods of prevention and detection. It is, by nature, a “hands-on-keyboard activity,” driven by humans. Just like hunting in nature, anyone can do it, but the right experience and tools can make you much more effective."

  description: "AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Integrating it with cyber security is beneficial because it improves how security experts analyze, study, and understand cyber-crime.
In this talk, we will discuss & explain AI and how to integrate it with cyber security to detect many types of attacks. The talk will cover many applications in cyber security in which we can apply AI to improve those applications. Finally, we will present a demo on how to build your development environment with some scripting examples."

a Transparent Internet"
  #subtype: keynote
  speakers: [0]
  language: en
  description: "In recent times, internet censorship has increased throughout the world. With governments realising the potential of the internet in spreading information as well as misinformation.
To curb or rather control this, governments around the globe have taken to censoring parts of the internet by directing major ISPs to block access to those websites.
The ISPs around the globe have used different methods to block the access. Some resulting in DNS filtering to others doing SNI ( Server Name Information ) inspection.
There have been ways to bypass these restrictions, like DoH ( DNS over HTTPS ) and eSNI ( encrypted SNI ), now ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ), supported by TLS 1.3.
To counter these, some authoritarian regimes ( like China ) have blocked eSNI traffic altogether, to be able to sniff the traffic and block the websites accordingly on their ‘Great Firewall’.
I will be talking about how these different mechanisms of blocking user traffic works, by doing a live demo of packet analysis using wireshark."

 Without Loosing Your Mind"
  #subtype: keynote
  speakers: [2]
  language: en
  description: "If your Organization policies are still managed through GUI, we lose the benefits of audibility, repeatability, and testability of those policies such as access control, scan results evaluation, and other decision making procedures. Policy as code helps us manage policies in a declarative way and enforce them across your entire application and technology stack. If you wanted to learn about Policy as Code, and better yet get started with Policy as Code, join us in this talk where we teach you how to get started with Policy as Code through Open Policy Agent.

Some of the areas we will cover in this talk include:
1. The need for Policy as Code
2. Exploring Open Policy Agent
3. Understanding the constructs of a Declarative Policy Language
4. Walkthrough of Implementation use cases from application and container orchestration perspective

At the end of the session, you would gain a solid understanding  of:
1. The basics of Policy as Code
2. Introducing Policy as Code in your technology stack
3. The application of Policies through the Rego language in Open Policy Agent"

We also gonna learn what is the function for exploitation technique called Egg Hunter, and when is necessary to make use of this technique.
For end, we gonna learn create from zero an exploit, to exploit a Buffer Overflow vulnerability utilizing the technique SEH Overwrite with use of Egg Hunter, and we will looking for badchars to avoid errors in our shellcode, all this to get a reverse shell.

  description: "In 2021, the gaming industry generated $155 billion in revenue and by 2025, it is expected the industry will generate more than $260 billion in revenue. This makes it a lucrative target for cybercriminals.
To protect their user and fair experience, game publishers and developers fight endlessly against cheats and use every trick to protect their games, clients, from tampering and reversing engineering.  It is a cat and mouse game.
In this talk, we will explore the game cheating and anti-cheating techniques and tricks. How an attacker can get access to the game’s secrets and how security engineers fight and protect the game assets."

  description: "My talk is mainly for beginners who need to know more about the types of logic vulnerabilities and how to find and exploit these types of magic bugs. I’ll start by declaring the differences between logical and traditional bugs and why I’m looking for the logical ones first. 
As we know, the logical bugs have a variety of types, and you can find and exploit them by using multiple techniques, all you need to do is to focus on multiple points, so I’ll try to create a creative mindset to understand the business of the target and how the bug will affect him to get the most benefit from it like chaining bugs to get the highest impact you can achieve. 
Through the talk, I’ll get real-world scenarios of my logical findings to declare my words like Account takeover, Parameter tampering, Broken Access Control and more. Also, I’ll talk about 4 CVEs I assigned for the first time and declare how I managed to read internal bank documents, users’ transactions, companies deals, and more critical data by chaining and exploiting the vulnerable logic functions, parameters and endpoints.

In the Art of War, Sun Tzu said “Know thyself, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.“. Using MITRE Engage and MITRE ATT&CK, this panel will investigate how to combine cyber threat intelligence and threat modeling to inform and drive your use of adversary engagement. Along the way we will discuss real operations MITRE has conducted and reflect on where we succeeded and where we failed. We hope that listeners walk away with a better understanding of both ATT&CK and Engage and how to operationalize these frameworks within your organization."
