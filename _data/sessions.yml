  title: "Ransomware and Egypt: The Threat and How to Protect Your Organization"
  description: "In 2017 Egypt was one of the top countries affected by the WannaCry Ransomware, and, unfortunately, things have not gotten better. According to Trend Micro, Egypt accounts for more than a third of all ransomware attacks in North Africa. Egypt is an attractive target for ransomware cybercriminals because there are so many new business starting up, but they have limited budget for security.
This talk will review the ransomware threats, and discuss ways you can help defend your organization from ransomware, even on a tight budget. It will also provide an overview of resources you can use to better understand the threat and where to focus your limited security budget."

  description: "Deception is an evolving effective tool that will improve detection and defense capabilities of an enterprise netwrok. It can be integrated into existing defenses to provide more visibility into the enterprise, share threat intelligence data and feed SIEM with high probability alerts.

It is highly accurate and can provide deep insight into enterprise network to detect zero days and advanced APTs.

talk will be an overview of deception technology will be presented in this talk and we will learn how to plan, build and deploy a basic deception framework using free and open source tools.

  title: "Hunt Evil"
  description: "The ability to block advanced threats improves each year, but we face adversaries who are determined and creative, and their techniques evolve just as quickly. This raises a few questions: When prevention fails, what do we have left to protect our organizations? How can we discover gaps as fast as possible? Having techniques in play to detect and respond to ongoing attacks quickly is as important as prevention.
Threat hunting is a critical discipline that more organizations are using to disrupt stealthy attacks before they become mega breaches. It is the active search for “unknown unknowns,” which describes new and novel attack behaviors that aren’t detected by current automated methods of prevention and detection. It is, by nature, a “hands-on-keyboard activity,” driven by humans. Just like hunting in nature, anyone can do it, but the right experience and tools can make you much more effective."

  title: "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly in Integrating AI with Cyber Security"
  description: "AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Integrating it with cyber security is beneficial because it improves how security experts analyze, study, and understand cyber-crime.
In this talk, we will discuss & explain AI and how to integrate it with cyber security to detect many types of attacks. The talk will cover many applications in cyber security in which we can apply AI to improve those applications. Finally, we will present a demo on how to build your development environment with some scripting examples."
