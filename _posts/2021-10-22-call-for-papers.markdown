#### Review Process:

After the CFP deadline, our review board have 1 month to look over all submissions and give a score to each proposal. A rejection and an acceptance lists will be built based on the given scores. 
The proposals with the highest score will move to the first batch of acceptance notice and strong rejections will be immediately sent out too. 



The board allows 1 week for the accepted proposals' speakers to respond. If the accepted speaker doesn't respond, doesn't want to or can't attend anymore, the board will move on with the next highest scored proposals in the acceptance list. 
Once the conference program is full, the board starts to provide feedback for the remaining submissions. We hope to manage notifying all the confirmed speakers at least 2 months before the conference date.
